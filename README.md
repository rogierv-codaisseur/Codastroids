### Welcome to

![Logo](https://github.com/rogierv-codaisseur/Kingdom-of-Tripolis/blob/master/screenshots/logo.png)

We built this game as a classic top-down rpg style puzzler.<br />
The aim of the game is to reach the Loot Chest first, while avoiding the skeletons.

The front-end was developed using only `React` and `Redux`.<br />
The back-end was implimented using `Websocket`

## Game Rules

Player 1 - Use arrow keys to navigate around the map.<br />
Player 2 - Use W A S D to bavigate around the map.<br />
Avoid the Skeletons! They will only move once a player moves.<br />
Player will respawn at start when hit by an enemy.<br />
Plan your moves carefully OR run like a crazed bat out of hell.<br />
Be the first to claim the LOOT!

## Run Locally

The `Server` is deployed to Heroku. <br />
If all dynos are running, you only need to run the `Client`

```sh
cd client/
npm install
npm run start
```

If dynos have been stopped, you can run the `Server` locally:<br />
*NOTE: Run `Client` as mentioned above*

```sh
cd server/
npm install
npm run start
```
